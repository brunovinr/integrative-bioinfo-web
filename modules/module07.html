            <h2>Module 07: An Introduction to Spatial Transcriptomics Approaches</h2>
            <p>Spatial transcriptomics is a rapidly evolving field that aims to provide a spatially resolved gene expression profile of a tissue or organ. This technology has the potential to advance our understanding of complex biological processes and help identify new biomarkers for disease diagnosis and treatment. The main goal of spatial transcriptomics is to capture the gene expression profile of individual cells (or a mini mixture of cells in a given region) in their native tissue context, allowing for the identification of cell types and their spatial distribution. This information can then be used to create detailed maps of gene expression within tissues, providing insights into cellular interactions, developmental processes, and disease progression. In this notebook, we will cover practical steps in setting up a spatial transcriptomics analysis pipeline using the Seurat package. We will cover the basic analysis to recover gene expression in different regions as well as cell type deconvolution approaches.</p>
